Chapter 1:

Extend Compilers :
+ Saves time and labor, no retraining of programmers, easy to do
- Performance depends on application, people can still write sequencial

Extend Lang:
+ Easy, quick, not expensive
- Debugging is hard, lack of compiler support to catch errors (old?), programmers hate

Chapter 2:

Diameter:
Maximum distance between any two processors

Bisection width:
Minimum number of communication links that can be removed to break it into two equal sized disconnected networks

Maximum edges:
Just count the maximum edges of a node

Constant length:
As the number of nodes increase, the amount of edges on each node ( only 2d mesh)

2d mesh is the only network which has constent length, and the others vary for the bisection and diameter variables.


Caches:

Large caches reduce the load on the memory bus, enabling the system
to utilize more processors e ciently. Even with large instruction and data caches, every processor still needs to access the memory bus occasionally.


Chapter 3:

If two processors to increase their utilization, their communication also increases, since it comes to racial conditions on the data itself.

Bionominal tree:
Create one node. This node has rank 0. Append one node to the tree and call that structure tree t. Append the last created t to the root node. The amount of nodes now doubles, and u just append on the root the new subtree.

Foster's Methodlogy:
Partitioning -> Communication -> Aggolomeration -> Mapping
 Dividing    Determine values passes   Group tasks  Task to processor

Allgather and scatter:
Gather and scatter have the same complexity
